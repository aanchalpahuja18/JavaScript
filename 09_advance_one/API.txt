API - Application Programming Interface
It is the communication medium/channel between 2 systems (they may be written either in java, php or java, ruby)
To establish a communication between both the systems we use APIs

We have 2 majorly used APIs as api.github.com/users/aanchalpahuja & randomuser.me

Since API may be difficult to read & understand we have further an easy tool to do so which is the JSON formatter.

All the APIs contain data in the object format.

fetch() is the newer version from which we can request the API

Earlier we would use XMLHTTP request to request the API & make a call.

XMLHTTP request it is completely written in AJAX.
