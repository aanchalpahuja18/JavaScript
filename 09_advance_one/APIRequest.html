    //we have status codes in XMLHttpRequest() which tells us the status of every state we are in the API calling. These codes are represented using 0 to 4 digits & these are known as the readyState codes. 

    //to use the XMLHTTP request we have to first create an object out of it.
    // XMLHttpRequest() => this contains all the methods inside it namely open(), send(), etc.

    const xhr =  new XMLHttpRequest()

    //Now to make a request to the API we will use the open() from XMLHttpRequest()

    //open() => takes 2 parameters, 1st the method to the api which is (get, post, put, patch) & 2nd the url to which we have to make a call.

    xhr.open('GET', 'https://api.github.com/users/aanchalpahuja18')
    //But by only specifying above wont make a call to the API we also have to use the send() to make an actual call to the API

    //to print the current ready state of the url we have:

    // console.log(xhr.readyState);

    // we can also track & monitor the api url continuously by using:
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){
        console.log(xhr.readyState);
        //readyState = 4 means that everything is okay & we have received the data. The object/json can be obtained with the help of responseText. 
        if(xhr.readyState === 4){
            const data =JSON.parse(this.responseText)

            //Most of the time whenever we get the response from the url it is in the string format & not object. 
            //Since the response is in the string format & we have to work with the JSON format we can just use the below method:
            //JSON.parse(response) => this will convert the string response into json & we can easily access the properties of the object further. 
            console.log(typeof data);
            console.log(data.followers);
            
            
        }
    }
    
    xhr.send()

Notes

console.log() & many other APIs like document are not the core part of js. 
Core JS has only basic arithmetic operations, functions, loops, are present.

console.log() => It is the debugging tool/dev tool of the browser. It is injected by the runtime environment of JS & is not the core part available inside JS. 

JS is started by runtime environment like NodeJS/browser. 
NodeJS is itself an implementation of the V8 engine.
V8 engine is built on C++ & JS also runs over C++ language.

V8 engine gives us some debugging tools/ API access, etc.
console.log() is also available in v8 only. Actual implementation is there inside the V8 which provides JS a runtime environment. 

V8 has the entire code available inside github.com/v8/v8

console.log() comes from the d8 folder which is inside github.com/v8/v8

Full JS is the wrapper over the C++ programming language. 

V8 is the Google's open source JS engine 

console.log() has a WriteTOFile() which tells the space in which we have to print our statements similar to cout in cpp
It basically informs the browser that inside inspect we have a console window into which we have to print the statements mentioned inside the console.log()
