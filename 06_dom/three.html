    //To create a new element inside the dom we have the foll property: 
    const div = document.createElement('div')
    console.log(div);
    div.className = "main"
    div.id = Math.round(Math.random() * 10 + 1)
    //The setAttribute property directly updates the property of the element & does not bring it first & overwrite it. 
    div.setAttribute("title", "Generated text")
    div.style.backgroundColor = "green"
    div.style.padding = "10px"
    // div.innerText = "My div"
    //Whereas in above properties 1st the existing value is brought & then the wished value is updates to the element & stored into it. So the extra round trip is required there. 


    //Above & below both the methods takes 2 round trips so we can discuss the optimize approach anytime. 

    //createTextNode creates a new text node which contains the text "My Div" inside it. 
    const addText = document.createTextNode("My Div")
    div.appendChild(addText)

    document.body.appendChild(div)
    //Now the above div is present inside the memory that is the reason it is not visible inside the webpage. We have to also write a certain function in order to bring the div inside the webpage & to attach it.
