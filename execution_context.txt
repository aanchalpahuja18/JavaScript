JS execution context means how will JS execute the code.
It does this by breaking our code into 2 parts.

Whenever we will give our code file into JS Global Execution Context (GEC) will be created first
this variable refers to the GEC & this refers to Window object in Browser

Types of EC:
1. Global EC
2. Functional EC
3. Eval EC (In Mongoose)

JS code is executed in 2 phases:
1. Memory Execution phase: In this phase only the memory is allocated to variables & functions & they are not executed.
2. Execution phase: Here actual execution of the code takes place

eg: code

let val1 = 20
let val2 = 30
function addNum(num1, num2){
    let total = num1 + num2;
    return total;
}
let result1 = addNum(3,4)
let result2 = addNum(val1, val2)
How does JS execute code?

1. A global execution context will be created which is referred with this
2. Memory Creation Phase is created in which all the variables & functions are allocated memory:
val1 -> undefined
val2 -> undefined
addNum -> function definition
result1 -> undefined
result2 -> undefined

3. Execution Phase:
val1 -> 20
val2 -> 30
addNum -> A separate execution context will be created inside which all the above 2 phases will be repeated & it happens as many times as a function is called. 
//After the execution context is created it gets deleted as soon as the function is executed successfully

//Call Stack follows a concept of LIFO! which simply means that the function which goes first in the call stack will come out last & vice versa


Summary: 
1. JS creates Global excution context 
2. Next it creates memory phase
3. Memory phase - In this phase,the variables are set to undefined until the execution phase(next phase) and the functions are set to their definitions.
4. Next it creates the execution phase
5. Execution phase - In this phase,the variables are initialsed to give values and when the functions are called,it creates a memory phase and execution phase for the function just like the main one.
